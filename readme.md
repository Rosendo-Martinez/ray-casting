# Ray Casting

A project that I made to play around with ray casting (lighting in graphics programming).

## Demo
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29eb081a-66f6-457f-8ecf-7d7d20636c4e

## Tech
- C++ (programming language)
- SFML (graphics library)
- Makefile (build tool)
- VS Code (IDE)
- GCC (compiler)
- GDB (debugger)

## Quick Guide Of Project Structure

### RayCasting.h & RayCasting.cpp
These are the files that contain the code that does the actual ray casting calculations.
These are the most important of this project, the rest are just files used for testing and visualizing 
the algorithms in these files.

### testAuto & testVisual
Both are used for testing. One runs automatic tests, the other opens a window where program
can be visual tested.

## Commands

The perquisites:
- SFML
- Makefile
- GCC

To build and run the program:
```
$ make testsVisual
```
